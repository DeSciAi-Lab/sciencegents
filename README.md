- **USD Value Integration**: Using direct market_cap_usd and token_price_usd values from the database
- **Bulk Synchronization**: Added 'Sync All ScienceGents' button in admin dashboard with progress tracking
- **UI Improvements**: Better formatting, consistent display of token values, and enhanced error handling

See the full [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for detailed release notes.
